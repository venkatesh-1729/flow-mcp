# flow-mcp

Drive **Google Flow** (flow.google.com) from Claude, Codex or any other MCP app — or from a local control
panel — using the credits already included in your Google AI subscription, not the pay-per-use video API.

It is a small program that runs on your own machine. It opens its own Chrome window, signs in
as you, and clicks Flow's real buttons. There is no browser extension, no hosted service and no
account to create.

```
Claude / Codex ──stdio──> flow-mcp ──Chrome DevTools Protocol──> Chrome (its own profile) ──> Flow
```

**MCP** = Model Context Protocol, the standard that lets Claude use outside tools.
New here? [OVERVIEW.md](OVERVIEW.md) explains what it does in plain English, with no code names.

## What you need

| | |
|---|---|
| **macOS or Windows 10/11** | Developed and tested on macOS. Windows is supported — Chrome, the computer's own voices, the Recycle Bin and the panel launcher all have Windows versions — but it hasn't been run on a real PC yet, so please report anything that breaks |
| **Node.js 22 or newer** | `node --version` |
| **Google Chrome** | Any recent version |
| **A Google AI subscription with Flow** | Pro or Ultra. This is where the credits come from |
| **FFmpeg** *(optional)* | Mac: `brew install ffmpeg` · Windows: `winget install Gyan.FFmpeg` — needed only to join clips, mix music or record narration |
| **A Google AI Studio key** *(optional, free)* | Only for the Google narration voices. See below |

A display must stay awake: the Chrome window is really being driven, so the machine cannot be
headless or asleep mid-run.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GTAI-1/flow-mcp.git
cd flow-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

> **Mac: do not put this folder in `~/Desktop`, `~/Documents` or `~/Downloads`.** macOS protects those
> folders, and apps that launch the server from there can be refused permission to read its own
> files (`EPERM: operation not permitted`). `~/flow-mcp` or anywhere in your home folder is fine.
>
> **Windows: keep it out of folders OneDrive syncs** (often Desktop and Documents), where files can be held
> online-only. `C:\Users\<you>\flow-mcp` is fine.

Then sign in, once:

```bash
npm run login
```

That opens the dedicated Chrome window. Sign into Google by hand, open (or create) a Flow project,
and leave the window open. The program never types your password — it only uses the session you
created. That Chrome profile lives in `~/.flow-mcp/chrome-profile` and is separate from your
everyday browser.

### Or: use the Chrome you are already signed in to (attach mode)

If Flow is already signed in in your everyday Chrome, the tool can work there instead (Chrome 144 or newer):

1. In that Chrome open `chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging` and turn on **Allow remote debugging for this browser
   instance**. (Turn it off there whenever you like; while it is on, any app on this computer can *ask* to control
   Chrome, and Chrome asks you first.)
2. Tell every flow-mcp process to use it, once:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.flow-mcp && echo '{"browser": "attach"}' > ~/.flow-mcp/config.json
   ```
   (or set `FLOW_MCP_BROWSER=attach` in the environment of each launcher).
3. On the first Flow call, Chrome asks whether to allow the connection: click **Allow**. The tool opens a Flow window of
   its own and never touches your other tabs; leave that window open (it may sit behind others, but not minimised).

Chrome asks again for every new connection. Keep one connection alive by leaving the panel running
(`npm run studio`, or the Studio served by the first MCP session): every other MCP session then goes through it
and nothing asks again. Your own downloads are untouched: the tool borrows a download folder only for its own file and
gives it straight back.

## Connect it to Claude or Codex

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude mcp add flow -- node /absolute/path/to/flow-mcp/dist/index.js
```

**Claude Desktop** — add to `claude_desktop_config.json` (Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/`, Windows:
`%APPDATA%\Claude\`). On Windows, write the path with doubled backslashes, like
`"C:\\Users\\you\\flow-mcp\\dist\\index.js"`:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "flow": { "command": "node", "args": ["/absolute/path/to/flow-mcp/dist/index.js"] } } }
```

**Codex** — add to `~/.codex/config.toml` (on Windows, `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\config.toml`):

```toml
[mcp_servers.flow]
command = "node"
args = ["/absolute/path/to/flow-mcp/dist/index.js"]
```

Or run `codex mcp add flow -- node /absolute/path/to/flow-mcp/dist/index.js`. No timeout setting is needed:
Codex, like most MCP apps, gives up on a tool call after 60 seconds, so any call that runs longer than about
45 seconds (creating a character, a 1080p download) answers with a task id instead and keeps working, and
`flow_wait` collects the result.

**Other MCP apps** (Cursor, VS Code and others) take the same command and arguments in their own MCP
settings. ChatGPT in the browser or the ChatGPT app can't use it: its connectors only reach servers on
the internet, and this tool has to run on your own computer to drive your Chrome window.

Developed and tested with Claude. Codex speaks the same protocol, so it should work the same way, but
it hasn't been tried yet — please report how it goes.

Restart the app, then ask it: *"check my Flow session"*. You should get your plan and credit balance
back. Everything after that is plain English — you never type tool names.

## Your first film

Nothing below costs a credit until step 4, and the assistant asks before spending.

1. **Check the session.** *"Check my Flow session."* — confirms sign-in, plan and credits.
2. **Make a character.** *"Create a character called Pip, a small lamplighter in a flat cartoon style."*
   Flow draws the portrait. Free.
3. **Draw the key frames.** *"Draw three stills with Pip: a dark rooftop, him lighting a lamp, the
   whole hillside glowing. Match each one to the last."* Free — stills cost nothing, so get the look
   right here before spending.
4. **Shoot it.** *"Turn those into three 10-second shots, each starting where the last one ended,
   720p, no more than 15 credits each."* This spends credits. The price is read from Flow's own
   quote first and the scene is skipped if it is over your cap.
5. **Narrate it.** *"Record this line with a warm documentary voice."* Free, any length.
6. **Cut it.** *"Join the three shots under the narration, don't freeze the last frame."*
   The finished file lands in `~/flow-mcp-out/<project>/`.

## The control panel

The same features, without an AI assistant in the loop:

```bash
npm run studio     # then open http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

or double-click **Flow Studio.command** (Mac) or **Flow Studio.cmd** (Windows).

Seven tabs, in the order you would use them:

- **Cast** — reusable characters: create, edit in place, or build one from a picture.
- **Frames** — free stills, with *match previous frame* to keep a set on-model.
- **Shots** — paid clips, with first/last frames, chaining, a live credit estimate, and a card that
  continues a finished clip from its own last frame.
- **Voice** — free narration in Google's voices or your computer's own. Your saved narrations are listed
  here to play or delete, and there's a field for your Google AI Studio key (checked with Google, stored
  only on your computer — never paste it into a chat).
- **Restyle** — change a clip you already have.
- **Cut** — join any videos into one film, in the order you pick: upload one, or choose from films you've
  already made. Add a narration (from your saved ones or an upload) and music, and turn the clips' own
  sound down so the narration sits on top.
- **Library** — everything in your Flow project: download it again for free (a scene comes down as one
  finished film, not loose clips), or move it to Flow's Trash.

A progress monitor and a gallery of your saved work sit alongside — the gallery shows stills or clips
on the tabs that use them. On a wide screen, each side scrolls on its own. Two kinds of delete, clearly
labelled: **Move to the Mac's Trash / Recycle Bin** removes a file from your computer; **Move to
Flow's Trash** removes it from your Flow project only. Both can be undone.

The panel ships with the repo but is not started for you — run `npm run studio` when you want it.
Opening `studio/index.html` as a plain file does nothing; the page needs the server behind it, and
says so in red if you try.

Claude's own process serves the same panel while it runs. Whichever process starts first owns the
Chrome tab and the job queue; the other talks to it over a local API, so Claude and the panel always
agree on what is running. That API listens on 127.0.0.1 only and needs a per-run token
(`~/.flow-mcp/token`).

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `flow_status` | Session state (signed in, which project is open, plan, credits left), queue, pacing, prompt playbook |
| `flow_project` | Open a project by its exact title, or create it (free) with `create: true`; with no title, list the projects |
| `flow_generate` | Queue scenes: prompt, image or video, model, aspect, duration, resolution, variants, first/last frame, reference images, `max_credits` cap, and an optional `name` (file name and Flow title, e.g. a shot id) |
| `flow_wait` | Wait for jobs, or for the task id of a slow call; returns file paths and results. Answers within about 40 s, so call again until `finished` is true |
| `flow_cancel` | Cancel a job that has not started |
| `flow_retry` | Re-queue failed jobs with the same settings and file names (a failed tile is first retried inside Flow with its own free Retry button: `retries`, default 1) |
| `flow_assets` | List images and videos already in the Flow project (usable as `asset:<title>`) |
| `flow_download` | Download existing project media without regenerating — free, including the 1080p / 2K upscale. A scene comes down as one stitched film |
| `flow_trash` | Move an image, video or scene in the Flow project to Flow's Trash, where it can be restored. Exact title only; refuses if two items share it; never deletes permanently |
| `flow_agent_images` | Fast image batch: hands up to 50 scenes to Flow's own Agent mode, rendered in parallel (20 images in ~204 s), 0 credits. Each image is matched back to its scene by its stored prompt, so file numbers are right in any finish order. Scenes the agent drops are re-asked of it (up to 2 rounds), then re-run one by one |
| `flow_edit` | Video-to-video edit of a clip already in the project (relight, weather, remove objects). Flow shows no quote first; about 20 credits for a 4 s clip |
| `flow_continue` | Start a clip from the last frame of an existing one **with a character or your avatar still attached** — the composer allows a start frame or attached characters, never both, so this drives Flow's agent mode, which does both. No quote beforehand |
| `flow_character` | Create a reusable character from a description (Flow draws the portrait) or an image, with a personality and a stock voice; use it as `asset:<name>` |
| `flow_character_edit` | Restyle an existing character in place (free) and save the new portrait; name, personality and voice are kept, so every scene referencing it updates. Pass `look` with the updated description; with only a name it re-saves the current portrait |
| `flow_characters` | List the project's characters |
| `flow_techniques` | 39 film-technique prompt presets (camera moves, product shots, transitions, image commands); pass an id as a scene's `technique` |
| `flow_narrate` | Free narration audio, any length: `gemini` (Google AI Studio text-to-speech — the same voices Flow has, plus a `style` note) or `mac` (a voice installed on this computer, no key needed) |
| `flow_voices` | Narrator voices available, and whether a Google key is set up |
| `flow_assemble` | Join clips into one MP4 — a project's clips, or any you list, in order — with optional music and voiceover, and separate volume for the clips' own sound (local FFmpeg, no credits) |

**Continuity between shots:** `chain_previous` (this clip starts on the last frame of the previous
one), `first_frame` + `last_frame` (animate between two stills you chose), `reference_images` (keep a
character or product consistent). Flow's *composer* takes either frames or references, never both — so
when you need a start frame **and** a character locked together, use `flow_continue`, which goes through
Flow's agent mode and does both.

Output lands in `~/flow-mcp-out/<project>/scene-NN.ext`, or `<name>.ext` for a named scene (a name already used gets
`-take2`, `-take3`). `project` can also be an absolute folder path, to save straight into a film's own folder.
`download_quality: "upscaled"` fetches the free upscale (1080p for a clip, 2K for a still) and never the 4K one, which
costs credits on a clip.

### Narration with Google's voices (optional)

`flow_narrate` with `engine: "mac"` uses your computer's own voices and works out of the box — macOS voices on a
Mac, the built-in speech voices on Windows. For Google's voices — the same ones Flow offers — get a free key from
[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and paste it into **Flow Studio → Voice → Google AI Studio
key → Save key**. It's checked with Google before it's saved, and stored only on your computer. Or set
`GEMINI_API_KEY`. Either way, never paste the key into a chat — it would end up in the conversation history.

## Behaviour and settings

- One generation at a time, with a random 25–70 second pause between them. The page carries an
  invisible reCAPTCHA; this drives the real interface at human pace and does nothing to evade it.
- Before each generation the server reads Flow's own credit quote and skips the scene if it exceeds
  `max_credits` (default 25).
- Downloads go only to `~/.flow-mcp/downloads` and are then moved into the project folder; `~/Downloads` is never
  watched, so nothing of yours is ever picked up by mistake.
- Environment variables: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `FLOW_MCP_PORT` (8787), `FLOW_MCP_OUTPUT`,
  `FLOW_MCP_HOME`, `FLOW_MCP_CDP_PORT` (9339), `FLOW_MCP_CHROME`, `FLOW_MCP_PAUSE_MIN_S`,
  `FLOW_MCP_PAUSE_MAX_S`, `FLOW_MCP_BROWSER` (`attach` = your own Chrome; also settable in `~/.flow-mcp/config.json`),
  `FLOW_MCP_CHROME_DATA` (that Chrome's data folder, if not the default).

## If something goes wrong

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| Mac: the server will not start, `EPERM: operation not permitted` | The folder is in a macOS-protected location. Move it out of `~/Desktop`, `~/Documents` or `~/Downloads` and update the path in your Claude config |
| *"Not signed in"* or *"no project open"* | Run `npm run login`, sign in, leave the window open; open a project with `flow_project` |
| Attach mode: *"Could not attach to your Chrome"* | Chrome's Allow prompt went unanswered (it waits 5 minutes), or remote debugging is off at `chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging` |
| *"Port 9339 is held by a Chrome that is not flow-mcp's own profile"* | Another automation Chrome holds the port. Close it, or set `FLOW_MCP_CDP_PORT` everywhere the tool starts |
| A clip generated but no file arrived | The media is still in Flow. `flow_download` pulls it back for nothing — never re-generate and pay twice |
| Everything times out | The Chrome window was closed, or the machine slept. Reopen it with `npm run login` |

## Licence and risk

This automates Flow's web interface. It can break whenever Google changes that interface, and
automated use may be against Google's terms of service. Use it on your own account, at your own
risk.
